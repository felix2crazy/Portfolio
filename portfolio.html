                    <h1>Felix Awadike</h1>
                    <p>A short description of the man Felix. I am a prolific entrepreneur, 
                        an interesting fellow with a natural aversion for sunlight. 
                    Felix is a brown haired , fair and tall person with a bubbly personality 
                    and a love for anything programming.

                    <h2>The Programmer Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Back in the room after my work was done on a boring morning I took out my brother's hp Laptop, and went through his
                        folders and stumbled on a particular one named "PROGRAMMING". I felt pulled inward, toward something that would define
                        me today. I went through the folder, watched the videos and read the things written about coding in general. I knew what
                        coding was. I needed to know more, a needle for a hungry vein. There's a palpable simmering whenever I am around code
                        nowadays, as if limitless potential is in there, churning, trying to escape (and it probabaly is).

                        overwhelmed.”

                <p>
                    I'm a full web stack developer specialized in React and Javascript (Node).
                    I have a passion for all things web and I also have immense passion for swimming (I'm an addict IMO). Favorite color?
                    black (or purple). Favorite activity? swimming (after working). Favorite food? I have no affiliation to a certain meal
                    as i love all equally (especially rice). Currently I work as a freelancer. You can always contact me for a project or
                    coffee.
